# About Me  

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm **Adriyansyah MF**, a cybersecurity practitioner with a strong passion for penetration testing, developing security systems, and simulating security scenarios. As a member of the Purple Team, I specialize in creating rules like YARA and strengthening system defenses.  

I often engage in technical projects, such as:  
- Building custom **active response scripts** for Wazuh.  
- Developing security challenge scenarios, like **Secure Vault** with various vulnerabilities.  
- Setting up Docker-based systems for security simulations with specific port configurations.  

I have hands-on experience with various technologies, including:  
- **SQLAlchemy** for database management.  
- **Grafana** for data analysis and visualization.  
- **React.js** for developing user interfaces.  
- **Python** for scripting and automation.  

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new things, such as creating animations with **GSAP** or developing code-based digital invitations.
